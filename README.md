# Remove VBA Line Numbers Add-In for MS Access
This 100% FREE Microsoft Access Add-In tool is designed to help you remove all of the VBA line numbers in your VBA project with a single button click.  I've also provided a standalone VBA subroutine to remove all line numbers from all code files in a VBA project, in case it's needed for one of the other MS Office apps aside from Access, like Excel or Word.
