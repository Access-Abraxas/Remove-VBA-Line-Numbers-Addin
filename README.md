# Remove-VBA-Line-Numbers-Addin
This Microsoft Access Add-In tool is designed to help you remove all of the VBA line numbers in your VBA project with a single button click.  I've also provided a standalone VBA sub to remove all line numbers from all code files in a VBA project, in case it's needed for one of the other MS Office apps aside from Access.
